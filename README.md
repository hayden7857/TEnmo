# Module 2 Capstone - TEnmo

Congratulations—you've landed a job with TEnmo, whose product is an online payment service for transferring "TE bucks" between friends. However, they don't have a product yet. You've been tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application.

## Use cases

1. **[COMPLETE]** As a user of the system, I need to be able to register myself with a username and password.
   1. A new registered user starts with an initial balance of 1,000 TE Bucks.
   2. The ability to register has been provided in your starter code.
2. **[COMPLETE]** As a user of the system, I need to be able to log in using my registered username and password.
   1. Logging in returns an Authentication Token. I need to include this token with all my subsequent interactions with the system outside of registering and logging in.
   2. The ability to log in has been provided in your starter code.
3. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to see my Account Balance.
4. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to *send* a transfer of a specific amount of TE Bucks to a registered user.
   1. I should be able to choose from a list of users to send TE Bucks to.
   2. I must not be allowed to send money to myself.
   3. A transfer includes the User IDs of the from and to users and the amount of TE Bucks.
   4. The receiver's account balance is increased by the amount of the transfer.
   5. The sender's account balance is decreased by the amount of the transfer.
   6. I can't send more TE Bucks than I have in my account.
   7. I can't send a zero or negative amount.
   8. A Sending Transfer has an initial status of *Approved*.
5. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to see transfers I have sent or received.
6. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to retrieve the details of any transfer based upon the transfer ID.
7. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to *request* a transfer of a specific amount of TE Bucks from another registered user.
   1. I should be able to choose from a list of users to request TE Bucks from.
   2. I must not be allowed to request money from myself.
   3. I can't request a zero or negative amount.
   4. A transfer includes the User IDs of the from and to users and the amount of TE Bucks.
   5. A Request Transfer has an initial status of *Pending*.
   6. No account balance changes until the request is approved.
   7. The transfer request should appear in both users' list of transfers (use case #5).
8. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to see my *Pending* transfers.
9. As an authenticated user of the system, I need to be able to either approve or reject a Request Transfer.
   1. I can't "approve" a given Request Transfer for more TE Bucks than I have in my account.
   2. The Request Transfer status is *Approved* if I approve, or *Rejected* if I reject the request.
   3. If the transfer is approved, the requester's account balance is increased by the amount of the request.
   4. If the transfer is approved, the requestee's account balance is decreased by the amount of the request.
   5. If the transfer is rejected, no account balance changes.

> Note: there are two check constraints in the DDL that creates the `transfer` table. Be sure to take a look at `tenmo.sql` to understand these constraints.

## How to set up the database

In the database folder, you'll find the database creation script `tenmo.sql`. Open this in SQL Server Management Studio and execute it.

## Authentication

The user registration and authentication functionality for the system has already been implemented. If you review the login code in `TenmoApp.cs`, you'll notice that after a successful authentication, the user is stored in `AuthenticatedApiService`, which is a base class for any API service that needs authentication. `TenmoApiService` derives from `AuthenticatedApiService`. At the same time the user is stored, the token is also stored in the `IRestClient` in that class.

`AuthenticatedApiService` also has three handy properties you may need in your client program:
* `IsLoggedIn` is a boolean telling whether the user has been authenticated.
* `UserId` is an integer which holds the user's id (when `IsLoggedIn == true`).
* `Username` is a string which holds the user's name (when `IsLoggedIn == true`).


## Set startup projects

Since both the client and server applications are included in the solution, you'll have to configure the solution to run both projects simultaneously. In Visual Studio, right-click the solution and select **Set Startup Projects...**. In the window that appears, select **Multiple startup projects** and set both "TenmoClient" and "TenmoServer" to have the action `Start`.
